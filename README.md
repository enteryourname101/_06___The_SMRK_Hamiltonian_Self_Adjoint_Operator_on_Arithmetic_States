# The SMRK Hamiltonian  
### Self-Adjoint Operator on Arithmetic States

## Overview

This document establishes a **rigorous self-adjoint realization** of prime-shift–based
arithmetic operators acting on ℓ²(N).

Its central purpose is analytic: to show that arithmetic Hamiltonians built from
prime-induced transitions admit **canonical self-adjoint operators** once properly
regularized and treated via quadratic form methods.

No spectral identification with zeta or L-functions is attempted here.

## Core Contribution

- Construction of regularized prime-shift operators
- Definition and analysis of associated quadratic forms
- Proof of closability and lower semi-boundedness
- Canonical self-adjoint realization via Friedrichs extension
- Stability of resolvents under regularization limits

## Why This Paper Matters

Formal symmetry is **not sufficient** for spectral meaning.
Without self-adjointness:
- spectra may be non-real,
- trace objects are ill-defined,
- spectral interpretations collapse.

This document provides the **analytic backbone** required by all subsequent SMRK
spectral and trace constructions.

## What This Paper Does NOT Claim

- No identification of spectra with zeta zeros
- No trace formulas
- No claims regarding RH

It is deliberately foundational.

---

## Status

**Rigorous functional-analytic foundation.**  
Non-conjectural.

## Relation to Other Documents

- Provides analytic support for:
  - SMRK Hamiltonian constructions
  - Trace conjectures
  - Spectral programs
- Should be read before any trace-level interpretation

## Intended Audience

- Functional analysts
- Operator theorists
- Mathematical physicists
- Readers checking analytic rigor
